# colore-snake
Snake! But it runs on your chroma keyboard!

The Colore C# Library was used. The speed at which the game runs and the field size is customizable in code. 

NOTE: This was done in a few hours just for fun and to get to know the Colore library. There was no extra time spend on an UI, optimization or code quality! :)
